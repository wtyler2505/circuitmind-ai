  "project_description": "CircuitMind AI is a personal project — my own intelligent, local-first electronics prototyping workspace built primarily for my own use at the bench. It bridges the gap between physical components and digital design by combining AI-assisted circuit synthesis, high-fidelity component rendering, and real-time simulation into a single, privacy-focused environment with a bold cyberpunk aesthetic. This is a Linux-first application, designed and optimized to run natively on Linux as the primary platform.\n\nProblem I'm solving for myself: Electronics prototyping tools today force you to choose between cloud-dependent platforms that compromise privacy, low-fidelity design tools that lack technical accuracy, or complex professional suites with steep learning curves. None of them are Linux-first, and none offer a unified workspace that is intelligent, visually rich, offline-capable, and respects data sovereignty. I'm building the tool I wish existed.\n\nWho benefits: Primarily me — a maker and engineer who wants a powerful, approachable design environment that runs entirely on my own Linux hardware with no cloud accounts, no telemetry, and no compromises. If others find it useful down the line, great, but this is built for my workflow first.\n\nPlatform focus: Linux-first. All development, testing, and optimization targets Linux as the primary OS. Browser compatibility, file system interactions, P2P networking, and performance tuning are all prioritized for Linux environments.\n\nCore capabilities:\n— Intelligence Engine (\"Eve\"): A Gemini-powered AI assistant with deep workspace awareness that generates wiring diagrams from natural language, provides proactive safety audits, and offers contextual mentorship. Eve has temporal and spatial awareness of every user action and canvas state.\n— High-Fidelity Asset Engine: Full Fritzing Part (.fzpz) compatibility with automatic unit normalization, SVG sanitization, and IndexedDB-backed binary caching. Components render with manufacturer-accurate detail on a standardized 0.1\" grid.\n— Real-Time Simulation: A Web Worker-powered DC nodal solver with logic propagation, short circuit detection, mixed voltage warnings, and live visual feedback (LED states, current flow indicators). Rule-based heuristics catch common design errors before physical assembly.\n— 3D Visualization: Three.js-powered geometry previews for spatial exploration of component layouts and circuit architecture.\n— Local Sovereignty: All data persists locally via IndexedDB and Git-as-data versioning (isomorphic-git). P2P sync over LAN using WebRTC with encryption — no central server required. Full undo/redo history survives browser restarts.\n— Neural-Link Gestures: MediaPipe hand tracking enables pinch-to-select, palm-to-pan, and swipe navigation for hands-free bench work.\n— Engineering Bootcamp: Interactive guided quests with real-time state validation, from \"Blink an LED\" to \"ESP32 WiFi Integration.\"\n\nTech stack: React 19 with Vite, federated context architecture, Web Workers for simulation and search indexing, Three.js for 3D, MiniSearch for client-side fuzzy search, JSZip and xml-js for FZPZ processing, and DOMPurify for SVG sanitization. All tooling chosen with Linux-native development in mind.\n\nWhat makes it unique: CircuitMind AI is the only prototyping tool that combines a context-aware AI assistant, Fritzing-grade component fidelity, real-time electrical simulation, gesture control, and absolute data sovereignty — all in a browser, all offline, all mine. And it's Linux-first, not Linux-as-an-afterthought.\n\nFirst milestone: The FZPZ Asset Integration pipeline is fully implemented — manifest-first hydration, robust loader with normalization, IndexedDB persistence, AI context bridging, and custom part importing are all complete. Next up: hardening P2P sync discovery and scaling the simulation engine for larger circuits.\n\nKey success metrics: Sub-100ms inventory hydration, 60FPS canvas interactions with up to 50 components, zero telemetry, 100% offline capability, and measurable AI suggestion acceptance rates via built-in engineering analytics.",
