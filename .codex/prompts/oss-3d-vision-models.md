# OSS 3D and Vision Model Landscape

Goal: provide an up-to-date list of models and their suitability.

## Steps

1. List models by category: text-to-3D, image-to-3D, view synthesis, encoders, segmentation.
2. For each: name, repo link, release date/month, license, strengths/limits.
3. Note notable datasets for mechanical CAD or parts.
4. Summarize a recommended short list.

## Output Format

## Text/Image to 3D

| Model | Repo | Release | License | Notes |
