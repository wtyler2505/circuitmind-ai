# Wiring Harness and Diagram Research

Goal: compile an actionable snapshot of tools and best practices.

## Steps

1. Based on FOCUS, gather TOP tools (web/desktop) with primary capabilities.
2. Summarize key features (routing, DRC, collaboration, BOM/labeling, testing).
3. Provide a best-practice checklist (safety, strain relief, bend radius, labeling, QA).
4. Provide 2-4 sources per tool.
