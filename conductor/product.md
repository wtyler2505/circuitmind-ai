# Product Definition: CircuitMind AI

## Vision
CircuitMind AI is an intelligent, futuristic workspace designed for electronics prototyping. It bridges the gap between physical components and digital planning by providing:
- **AI-Generated Wiring Diagrams:** Automatically generate accurate wiring schematics using Gemini models.
- **Interactive Inventory:** A managed library of components that syncs with diagrams.
- **Educational Exploration:** 3D visualizations and detailed pinout information for learning.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Local-First:** Optimized for privacy and local workflows.
- **Craftsmanship:** Prioritizes correctness and depth over speed.
- **Futuristic UX:** A highly visual, "Cyberpunk" aesthetic (Green/Dark) that feels like a sci-fi tool.

## Key Features
- **3D Diagramming:** Three.js-powered visualization of components and wires.
- **AI Assistant:** "Eve" / "Gemini" integration for chat, help, and diagram generation.
- **Voice Control:** Hands-free operation for electronics bench work.
