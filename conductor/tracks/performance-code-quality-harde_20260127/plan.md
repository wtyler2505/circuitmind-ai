# Implementation Plan: Performance, Types & Maintenance

- [ ] Batch convert `public/assets/ui/` PNGs to optimized WebP.
- [ ] Define document interfaces in `OmniSearch.tsx` to fix `unknown` access.
- [ ] Global search and replace `console.log` with `auditService.log`.
- [ ] Systematic resolution of all TODO/FIXME markers in the codebase.
- [ ] Re-run `hyperfine` to document performance gains.
