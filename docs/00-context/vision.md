# Vision: CircuitMind AI

## Purpose
CircuitMind AI is an intelligent, futuristic workspace designed for electronics prototyping. It bridges the gap between physical components and digital planning by providing a high-fidelity, AI-assisted design environment that prioritizes craftsmanship and local-first privacy.

## Boundaries
- **In-Scope:**
  - AI-generated wiring diagrams (Gemini-powered).
  - High-fidelity component management using the Fritzing Part (.fzpz) specification.
  - Real-time logic and nodal simulation.
  - 3D visualization of circuits.
  - Local-first data persistence via IndexedDB and Git-as-data.
- **Out-of-Scope:**
  - Cloud-only storage (unless explicitly requested for sync).
  - High-voltage power system simulation (>50V DC).
  - Full mechanical CAD (focused on electronics/PCBs).

## Core Value Proposition
- **Local-First:** Optimized for privacy and offline-capable workflows.
- **Craftsmanship:** Prioritizes technical correctness and visual depth.
- **Cyberpunk UX:** A "Neon-Dark" aesthetic that enhances focus and feels like a futuristic terminal.
