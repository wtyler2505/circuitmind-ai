# Education: Engineering Bootcamp

The "Engineering Bootcamp" subsystem transforms the design workspace into a guided learning environment, flattening the curve for electronics prototyping.

## Core Pillars

### 1. Interactive Quests
- **Step Machine:** A stateful engine that validates application state against specific "Success Conditions."
- **Real-Time Validation:** Automatically checks if the user has added the correct part or connected the right pins before proceeding to the next step.
- **Quest Registry:** A library of curated tutorials ranging from "Blinking an LED" to "ESP32 WiFi Integration."

### 2. Proactive Mentorship
- **Contextual Guidance:** Gemini (Eve) provides natural language context for each quest step, explaining *why* certain design choices are made.
- **Visual Anchoring:** Highlights and HUD pulses guide the user's eye to specific UI elements (e.g., the inventory button or a specific pin).

### 3. Pinout Exploration
- **Educational HUD:** Hovering over any pin on a microcontroller or sensor provides detailed functional descriptions (e.g., "GPIO13 / ADC2 / TOUCH4").
- **3D Visualization:** High-fidelity 3D models allow users to explore component geometry and spatial arrangements in an immersive view.
