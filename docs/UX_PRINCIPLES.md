# CircuitMind UX Principles

These principles keep the product coherent as it grows. If a change breaks these, redesign it.

## 1) Instrument-Panel Mentality
- The app behaves like a cockpit, not a chat app.
- Users should feel in control, not “inside” a UI toy.

## 2) Clarity Over Decoration
- Effects must clarify hierarchy or interaction.
- No visual noise that competes with wiring or content.

## 3) Density With Purpose
- Desktop-first. Controls must be easy to find.
- Dense does not mean cramped. Every pixel earns its place.

## 4) Predictable Interactions
- Buttons behave the same across panels.
- Hover actions must also exist for keyboard users.
## 5) The Quiet Center
- The canvas is the star.
- Sidebars support the mission, never steal it.

## 6) Strong First-Use Guidance
- Empty states teach the next action.
- Every blank screen should help the user move.

## 7) Accessibility as Power
- Targets are large enough to hit fast.
- Tooltips and labels exist for icon-only controls.

## 8) Consistency Wins
- The UI should feel like one system.
- If it looks like a one-off, rework it.
