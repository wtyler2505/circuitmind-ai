Draw a breadboard diagram showing an external LED connected to an Arduino Uno.
The LED’s **anode** should connect through a 220 Ω resistor to digital pin 8 on
the Arduino.  The **cathode** should connect directly to the GND rail.  Use
colors to differentiate the resistor and jumper wires and label the LED’s
polarity.
